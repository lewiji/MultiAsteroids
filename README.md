MultiAsteroids
==============

A simple multiplayer asteroids clone built with Slick2D and Kryonet

This game was built as a rapid prototype for a university module in Networked Games Development. It's not optimised, not very well architected, and doesn't handle disconnects very well, but it works as a proof of concept and is kinda fun!
